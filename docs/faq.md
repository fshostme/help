## Free Servers

<summary>How long can I use a free server?</summary>

Free servers will stay online for as long as you're playing on it. However, you do need to join the server within 5 mins to stop it being killed for inactivity.

<summary>Can I upgrade my free server to Pro?</summary>

While you cannot directly upgrade a free server, you can rent a Pro server separately and most of the settings are configured already.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are there any limitations on free servers?</summary>

Free servers have limitations on features (fewer plugins/mods), and location availability compared to Pro servers. See the [Free vs Pro](/servers/free-vs-pro) page for detailed comparisons.

## Pro Servers

<details>
<summary>How much do Pro servers cost?</summary>

Pro server pricing varies based on the game. Our price includes an 18-slot (player limit) server, and it's possible to increase if you require more, for a small extra fee per month. Visit our [pricing page](https://fshost.me/pro/pricing) for current rates.

<details>
<summary>What payment methods do you accept?</summary>

We accept various payment methods including credit cards, PayPal, and other popular payment providers. Our payment processor is Stripe so you can check on their site for supported countries.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I cancel my Pro server subscription?</summary>

We don't currently run a subscription for servers. All payments are manual top-ups by you so we can't take any money without it being in your FSHOST account balance first.
