# Pricing Changes - January 2026

**Effective Date:** 1st January 2026

We've been improving our Pro offering since we introduced it in 2022 and it's time we brought the pricing inline with what we offer.

This will come into effect 1st Jan 2026 and will be applicable to **new Pro servers only**.

If you want to keep your existing pricing, keep your current servers active by not letting it expire and delete.

## New Pricing

| Game | Current Price | New Price |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| Call of Duty 4 | €5.00/month | €6.00/month |
| Counter-Strike 1.6 | €5.00/month | €6.00/month |
| Counter-Strike: Source | €5.00/month | €6.00/month |
| Counter-Strike: Global Offensive | €6.00/month | €7.00/month |
| Counter-Strike 2 | €6.00/month | €7.00/month |
