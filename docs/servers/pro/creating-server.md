# Creating a Pro Server

Step-by-step guide to creating a new :zap: **Pro** game server on FSHOST.me.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. Created an FSHOST.me account
2. Verified your email address
3. Chosen your game from the **[List of Games](https://fshost.me/games)**
4. Clicked "Upgrade to Pro"

## Step 1: Create Server

1. From the pricing page, check over the features and locations offered for the game.
2. Once happy, click "Create".

## Step 2: Select your Location

1. Pick the server location closest to your players - see **[Ping Test](/network/locations#ping-test)**
2. Click Create Server

Switching location can be done by staff but is limited to 2-3 moves per server.

See **[Server Locations](/network/locations)** for detailed information.

## Step 3: Configure Server

### Basic Configuration

**Hostname**
- You're free to use most characters
- Visible to players (game-dependent)
- Can be changed later

**Server Slots**
- Number of player slots (some bots take slots themselves)
- Limited to 18 for most games
- Higher slots available - contact us for pricing

**Game Version**
- Some games support multiple versions
- Pick latest if unsure - contact support if you need help

### Advanced Options

Some games offer additional options:

- Server password
- Game mode/mod
- Cracked
- Bots
- Map selection (workshop/custom)
- Difficulty settings

::: warning
Advanced options vary by game. If unsure, just set it to what you think and you can change them later!

## Step 4: Review and Finish Setup

Review your selections and then click **"Save"** to finish setup.

## First Start

Once setup is complete:

1. Server status changes to "Stopped"
2. Click **"Start"** to boot the server
3. Wait 30-60 seconds for startup
4. Status changes to "Running" once ready

## Getting Connection Details

After server is running:

1. You will see the connection details at the top by the status
2. You can check on the Players/CPU/Memory stats in the **Overview** tab
3. If you need file access, check the Files tab to see if FTP has already been partly setup and follow instructions.
4. If there's no FTP details, we may not allow it for the game you've created (our pricing page will state this). Ask support.

Share these details with players to connect!

## Post-Creation Steps

### Game-Specific Server Management

Different games have different ways to manage them:

- Planned: We're working on bringing all our guides here from our old documentation.

## Common Issues

### Can't Start Server

Server created but won't start:

- Check **[Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/)**
- Review error logs in console
- Verify game-specific requirements

Contact us if it appears to be a problem with the server and not something you've modified.

## Limits and Quotas

### Pro Accounts

- Multiple servers allowed
- Higher availability
- Multiple servers per game
- FTP includes storage quota, please contact us if you need it increased
