# Server Moves

Need to move your server to a different region or machine? We can help with that.

## What is a Server Move?

A server move involves transferring your entire server setup to:

- **Different Region** - Move to a location closer to your players
- **Different Machine** - Transfer to another server in the same region

All your files, configurations, and settings are moved for you.

## How Server Moves Work

### The Process

1. **Contact Support** - Request a server move via **[Pro Support](https://fshost.me/pro/support)**
2. **Choose Location** - Select your new region (see [Server Locations](/network/locations))
3. **We Handle It** - Our team moves all your files and configuration
4. **New Ports Assigned** - Your server will receive new port numbers
5. **Ready to Go** - Move typically completes in around 10 minutes

::: tip
Your server will be offline during the move process. Plan accordingly!

## What Gets Moved

## Move Limitations

### Annual Limit

Server moves are limited to **2-3 moves per year** per server.

This ensures:
- Fair resource allocation
- Stable server performance
- Reduced administrative overhead

### When Moves Are Needed

Common reasons for server moves:

- **High Latency** - Moving closer to player base
- **Performance Issues** - Transferring to different hardware
- **Player Location Changed** - Community relocated
- **Regional Events** - Temporary location change for tournaments
