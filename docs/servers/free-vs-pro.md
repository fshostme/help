# Free vs Pro Servers

## Our Mission

We started FSHOST to help gamers play together without the barrier of expensive hosting and complex settings. Free servers will always be our foundation, it's in our name, and they're here to stay.

**Pro servers help us keep the lights on** and continue offering free hosting to everyone. When you upgrade to Pro, you're not just getting better performance, you're supporting a small team keeping free gaming accessible.

## Free Servers

Our free servers are genuinely free, forever. No credit card required, no request limit, no catch. They'll just stop when you stop playing.

**What You Get:**
- Full game server functionality
- Community/free support via Discord
- Select server locations similar to Pro
- Perfect for small groups/teams (we limit to max 14 players depending on game)
- Basic settings and predefined plugins

**Trade-offs:**
- Ads displayed in various places including hostname/chat and on the website (that's another way we keep it free!)
- Community support only (no private tickets)
- Limited per location, can't always get one at peak times

**Great For:**
- Playing with friends
- Testing and learning
- Small communities
- Casual gaming sessions

## Pro Servers - Support Our Mission

By choosing Pro, you help us continue offering free servers and making improvements to our website.

**What You Get:**
- High-performance dedicated resources (we run high-end AMD Ryzen CPUs)
- Ticket-based priority support
- Similar server locations to free
- Ad-free control panel and server
- Monitoring by us as standard (we'll probably fix your server before you know about it)
- Advanced features and customisation
- Higher player capacity (all pricing includes up to 18 players and can be increased for extra)
- Warm fuzzy feeling of supporting independent hosting

**Best For:**
- Active communities that rely on their server
- Competitive gaming where performance matters
- Training or Team matches
- Anyone who wants to support us!

## Why Upgrade to Pro?

### You Need More Customisation
If our free server options aren't enough and you need to customise your server, Pro gives you that.

### You Want to Support Us
We often come across players that have followed our journey and want to support us. You're helping the gaming community.

### You Need Reliable Support
Pro users get ticket-based support directly from us (the 2 people who built FSHOST). We prioritize Pro issues and typically respond within hours, if not minutes.

### You're Running a Community/Organisation
If people or team members depend on your server being up 24/7, Pro's dedicated resources, automatic error alerts to us, and priority support give you peace of mind.

## Pricing

Pro servers start at just 5 euros per month. Check our **[Pro Pricing Page](https://fshost.me/pro/pricing/)** for more info for each game.

## Can I Upgrade Later?

Absolutely! Start free, upgrade when you're ready, or don't:
- You can still create free servers even after going Pro
- There's a 1-month grace period before Pro servers are deleted
- No price changes for the life of your server
