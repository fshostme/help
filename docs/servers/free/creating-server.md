## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. Created an FSHOST.me account
2. Verified your email address
3. Chosen your game from the **[List of Games](https://fshost.me/games)**
4. Clicked "Start Free"

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Configure Basic Settings

You'll be asked to configure:

- **Server Location**: Whichever you prefer - see **[Ping Test](/network/locations#ping-test)**
- **Hostname**: What your server will be called and is shown in server browser
- **Server Slots**: Number of player slots (free is limited)
- **Game Version**: Usually the latest is recommended
- Other settings are available based on game


### 4. Panel

After clicking "Create", your server will begin to start:

- Very fast setup, usually 30-60 seconds.

### 5. Controlling Your Server

- **Port**: Listed next to the IP
- **Password**: Set in server configuration (if applicable)

Once you've joined the server, you can then login to RCON and start using commands.
