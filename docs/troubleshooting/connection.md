# Connection Problems

Troubleshooting when players cannot connect to your game server.

## Quick Diagnostics

### Is the Server Running?

First, verify your server is actually online:

1. Check **[Dashboard](https://fshost.me/pro/servers)**
2. Status should be 🟢 **"Running"** (green)
3. If not, start the server
4. Wait 30-60 seconds for full startup
5. Check console to see if it's outputting logs

### Get Correct Connection Info

Players need the right details:

1. Find IP and Port in dashboard
2. Copy exact text shown on the panel (e.g. `12.345.67.89:30015`)
3. Share password if server is protected

## Common Connection Issues

### "Connection Failed"

**Symptoms**: Can't connect at all

**Causes & Solutions**:

**Firewall Blocking**
- Player's firewall may block game
- Add game to firewall exceptions
- Try disabling firewall temporarily

**ISP blocking the IP**
- ISPs (Internet Service Providers) blocking the connection
- You can try ask your ISP about the block and explain that you can't join your game server
- Ask support to move your server to a different region (see [Server Moves](/servers/pro/server-moves))

### "Version Mismatch"

**Symptoms**: Client/server version different

**Causes & Solutions**:

**Outdated Server**
1. Check for "Steam Update Required"
2. Update and wait for it to boot back up

**Outdated Client**
- Player needs to update game
- Verify game files on Steam

## Other Issues

### Server Location Issues

High ping due to distance:

- Player far from server location
- Consider server in different region (if available)

### Player's ISP

Some ISPs block game ports or IPs:

- Player should contact ISP
- Try VPN as workaround
- Not much we can do server-side
